# WeatherDemoRepo

I have created a dotnet core webapi for implementing this weather api service call.

#How to run service
go to project folder location /WeatherDemoRepo/WeatherDemoApp/
execute command : dotnet build
execute command : dotnet run

it will be accessed on http://localhost:5000/api/weather

all files will be placed here: /WeatherDemoRepo/WeatherDemoApp/WeatherDemoApp/StaticContent/Output/
names will be as : Weather26072019.json

you can also download all cities weather data for each day at : http://localhost:5000/output/Weather26072019.json
you need to change file name last part of date : ddMMyyyy format

city input file is present on this location : /WeatherDemoRepo/WeatherDemoApp/WeatherDemoApp/StaticContent/LocationList.txt
